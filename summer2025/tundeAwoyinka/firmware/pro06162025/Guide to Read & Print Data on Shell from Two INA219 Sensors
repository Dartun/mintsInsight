%%%%% Guide to Read & Print Data on Shell from Two INA219 Sensors %%%%

Step 1: Begin by accessing the root folder 
          su teamlary   %% to access the root folder or working directory

Step 2. What You Need Installed on the Raspberry Pi
Run this once in terminal to install required Python libraries:

        sudo apt update %% not really important
        sudo apt install python3-pip -y   %% very important, this command will install python 
        pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-ina219    %% install this for CircuitPython-based i.e if 
                                                            you're using adafruit-circuitpython-ina219 library
        pip3 install --upgrade adafruit-circuitpython-ina219   %% to update the adafruit-circuitpython-ina219 library 
        sudo pip3 install pi-ina219   %% install this if you're using Adafruit_Python_INA219 library, which uses 
                                          the INA219(busnum=..., address=...) format — that’s a different older library (not CircuitPython-based).

Step 3. I2C must be enabled
Enable I2C on your Pi if you haven’t already, using:

        sudo raspi-config

Go to Interfacing Options
Select I2C
Choose Yes
Then reboot.

Step 4: Check if Sensors Are Detected
Use this command to check I2C addresses:

        i2cdetect -y 1

Step 5: Create a Python Script to Print the Voltage & Current from Two INA219s by following this:

i. Create the Python script file. In the terminal, run:

        nano filename.py

ii. Paste the full script( i.e your written python code for sensor reading) into Nano

iii. Save the script after pasting in Nano, by pressing:

      Ctrl + O → (write the file)
      Enter → (confirm file name)
      Ctrl + X → (exit Nano)

iv. Run the script. Now in terminal, run:

      python3 read_ina219.py    %% It will print voltage and current from both INA219 sensors every 10 seconds provided no error in code or library not found issues

V. To edit the Script incase of error, run:
      
      nano filename.py  %% i.e same file name you use previously
